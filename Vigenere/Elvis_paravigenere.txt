wise men say
only fools rush in
but i cant help falling in love with you
shall i stay
would it be a sin
if i cant help falling in love with you
like a river flows
surely to the sea
darling so it goes
some things are meant to be
take my hand
take my whole life too
for i cant help falling in love with you
like a river flows
surely to the sea
darling so it goes
some things are meant to be
take my hand
take my whole life too
for i cant help falling in love with you
for i cant help falling in love with you
